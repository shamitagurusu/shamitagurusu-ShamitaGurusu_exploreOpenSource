This repository was created during the Girls Who Code College Loops Explore Open Source Challenge.

This project is part of the Explore Open Source Challenge through Girls Who Code and College Loops. In this challenge, we responded to the following prompt: 

Delilah is a self-starter, and she created an app to get young girls excited about learning technology. Many kids have already tested the app, and she has been getting very positive reviews. Since Delilah sourced most of her user-testers through her network, their backgrounds are all very similar to hers. Delilah wants her app to be more inclusive, but she doesnâ€™t know how to find and approach more potential user-testers from underrepresented minorities. What can be some first steps?

My response to the prompt is below:

Delilah can respond directly to this user and explain to this user that in no way was it her intention & thank the user for helping her realize what she could do to make her app more inclusive. Delilah can also publish a new version of the app with pictures that are more inclusive and also develop more inclusive framework for her app,
